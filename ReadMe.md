# Titanic Survival Analysis 🚢

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival. The analysis is performed entirely in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and focuses on **data cleaning, visualization, and insight extraction**.

The notebook contains **10 well-structured charts**, each answering a specific analytical question about survival patterns. This project is designed to be **portfolio-ready** and suitable for academic or professional presentation on GitHub.

## 📊 Visual Analysis (10 Charts)

The notebook includes **10 data visualizations** that explore survival from multiple perspectives. Below is the recommended way to display them in GitHub.

> 📌 **Important:** Export your charts from the notebook and save them inside the `images/` folder using the filenames below (or adjust names accordingly).

### 1️⃣ Survival Rate by Gender

**Insight:** Higher ticket fares were associated with better survival chances.

---

### 7️⃣ Survival vs Fare

![Survival vs Fare](images/chart_07.png)
**Insight:** Survivors generally paid higher fares than non-survivors.

### 8️⃣ Family Size Distribution

![Family Size](images/chart_08.png)
**Insight:** Passengers traveling alone had lower survival rates.

---

### 9️⃣ Survival by Family Size
